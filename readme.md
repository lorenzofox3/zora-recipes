This is a work in progress explaining the different steps that come when testing a Javascript Library or application. Many people now use big black boxes tools
and forget the logic behind. Once they want to use one of these tools a bit differently they usually hit a wall. This tutorial tries to explain step by step what theses tools potentially do
by splitting the process into small commands piped together. We have chosen this particular set of tools exactly because most of the time they do only one thing but they do it well.
