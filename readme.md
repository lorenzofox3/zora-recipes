# Recipes

This is a work in progress explaining the different steps that come when releasing a Javascript Library. Many people now use big black boxes tools
and forget the logic behind. Once they want to use one of these tools a bit differently they usually hit a wall. This tutorial tries to explain step by step what theses tools potentially do
by splitting the process into small commands piped together. We have chosen this particular set of technologies particularly because most of the time they do only one thing and they do it good.
If you wish to propose other tutorials with other technologies please do so but put them under the `misc` category.
